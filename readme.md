Hello & Welcome to this git page. Here I just created my own 
virtual assistant with just a few lines of code. It is not an 
issue if you are a beginner, or an advanced coder this way of 
building your own virtual assistant is very simple and quick.

The only major thing required from your side is the will to go
step by step with me and by the end of it you will have your own
virtual assistant up & running as a charm.

2. Python Environment (Like Anaconda)
